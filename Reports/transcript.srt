1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
I'm a show. 

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,800
And if you need to, you can put that on the type of body, that helps you. 

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,440
Okay. 

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,320
So Okay. 

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,760
So we're gonna do something with picture reading because this can be you can think about pictures. 

6
00:00:14,795 --> 00:00:17,675
It can unscramble that and distract us some. 

7
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:18,155
Alright. 

8
00:00:18,155 --> 00:00:20,235
Would you like to look at ten apps. 

9
00:00:20,235 --> 00:00:21,995
These are Christmas y photos. 

10
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:25,115
So if you're like, I don't do Christmas, then take this one. 

11
00:00:25,115 --> 00:00:25,835
This is more. 

12
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:27,115
You know, it's Christmas there. 

13
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,860
These two are Santa in them. 

14
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,180
So do you have a picture you'd like to look at? 

15
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,100
I don't know if you're a big celebrator Christmas or not. 

16
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:39,540
Xmas. 

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:39,700
Yeah. 

18
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,300
I know you're not religious. 

19
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:41,940
Aren't you? 

20
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:43,295
Express. 

21
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:43,455
K. 

22
00:00:43,455 --> 00:00:44,575
Do wanna do this one? 

23
00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:45,135
This one? 

24
00:00:45,135 --> 00:00:46,895
Or this this is one, two, or three? 

25
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:48,575
Which one would you like to do? 

26
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:50,495
You're gonna do three. 

27
00:00:50,495 --> 00:00:51,055
Okay. 

28
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:52,335
So this one. 

29
00:00:52,655 --> 00:00:57,570
So this is only a Christmas scene because of oh, I guess it's a couple aspects, but it doesn't really Mhmm. 

30
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,410
It's more of a winter scene than Christmas scene, so it's so it's nice that way. 

31
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,570
So let's start with We do open presents at Christmas. 

32
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:04,370
Open presents. 

33
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:04,690
Okay. 

34
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,890
So you still celebrate Christmas. 

35
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,290
You're just personally not a believer in God. 

36
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,970
That's it's fascinating to me. 

37
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,650
And I hate to do that. 

38
00:01:12,185 --> 00:01:15,065
Are you guys religious at all of the family or just Yeah. 

39
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:15,465
Okay. 

40
00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:15,785
Yeah. 

41
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:17,065
So you're just Everything. 

42
00:01:17,225 --> 00:01:20,825
You're you're you're the one who's saying not just your frontage? 

43
00:01:20,825 --> 00:01:21,385
Okay. 

44
00:01:21,945 --> 00:01:23,705
So here we go. 

45
00:01:23,705 --> 00:01:25,385
Let's take a look at this right here. 

46
00:01:25,545 --> 00:01:30,060
The first task is gonna sound simple because you could ask them, do y'all do this? 

47
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,460
But the goal is just to work on you being able to scan with more ease. 

48
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,260
Okay? 

49
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,900
And then start noticing other details. 

50
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,325
Even I benefit this activity, even though I can scan the environment, I benefit this activity too. 

51
00:01:43,325 --> 00:01:44,925
So it's something we can all work on. 

52
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:49,085
So the identification is due to working on scanning also what you're seeing. 

53
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:53,165
So I am noticing, first off, is this dog here. 

54
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,640
K? 

55
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,560
What are you gonna see in this picture here? 

56
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,400
Oh, how long was my x? 

57
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,280
G then, I and n. 

58
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,175
Oh, it's just G, I then, s r and l. 

59
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:07,895
So square that. 

60
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:11,575
G lift, I lift, bar max, l. 

61
00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:15,015
And just kinda make sure you pull back a little bit more, and that will help. 

62
00:02:15,015 --> 00:02:16,615
Let's go to assess, actually. 

63
00:02:16,615 --> 00:02:18,615
So you have a drill. 

64
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:19,015
Yes. 

65
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:20,775
I did a couple of drills in there. 

66
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:21,895
Let me mix it all back. 

67
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,840
K. 

68
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,800
I am noticing the string Uh-huh. 

69
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,760
Going through. 

70
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,880
What are you noticing? 

71
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,360
You're noticing a Uh-huh. 

72
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,880
Push it through. 

73
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,655
H then o and m then fix that. 

74
00:02:38,655 --> 00:02:39,375
Try that now. 

75
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:39,935
It's okay. 

76
00:02:39,935 --> 00:02:40,575
It's six. 

77
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:41,615
E. 

78
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:42,415
Home. 

79
00:02:42,415 --> 00:02:43,055
Good. 

80
00:02:43,215 --> 00:02:44,735
So now Hearts. 

81
00:02:44,895 --> 00:02:45,295
K. 

82
00:02:45,295 --> 00:02:47,375
I am able to see these two robins. 

83
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:49,135
They're curious to me. 

84
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:51,695
These birds. 

85
00:02:51,935 --> 00:02:52,255
K. 

86
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,135
What do you wanna sing? 

87
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,870
For your dad's video, he should know what you're looking at. 

88
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,190
K. 

89
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,390
You're noticing? 

90
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,150
The Context. 

91
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,990
Context and the what? 

92
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,590
No. 

93
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,310
Go for it. 

94
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,110
Look right here. 

95
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,910
What do you see? 

96
00:03:09,945 --> 00:03:10,665
No. 

97
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:15,785
You're noticing the m then o then n. 

98
00:03:15,785 --> 00:03:16,345
The moon. 

99
00:03:16,345 --> 00:03:18,265
Can you do two double taps on that moon? 

100
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:19,465
Yeah. 

101
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:20,345
The moon's a full moon. 

102
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:21,625
That is pretty bright. 

103
00:03:22,105 --> 00:03:24,105
I actually love it when I come home from my workshop. 

104
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,360
In the evening, I fly home, and it is snowing outside or snowed. 

105
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,960
Not snowing, but snowed. 

106
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,760
I like to walk out at midnight because it's, like, bright. 

107
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,200
So it's because the reflection of the moon on the the snow base at bright. 

108
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:40,645
So it's still dark outside, but you can see everything. 

109
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:44,405
It's just really peaceful because everyone's sleeping while you're there. 

110
00:03:44,405 --> 00:03:46,165
So it's kinda it's kind of a cool time. 

111
00:03:46,245 --> 00:03:48,245
So this is a scene that we can see. 

112
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:54,090
It's kind of more of a nighttime zoom scene due to the fact that you have this moon up, sort of evening z. 

113
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,210
For blustering pain. 

114
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:55,770
K. 

115
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,250
But not better than I because you have Lysol in the house. 

116
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,770
So k. 

117
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,410
What else? 

118
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,330
I was noticing other things too. 

119
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,610
We're noticing what? 

120
00:04:05,225 --> 00:04:10,025
V then, o n y as in boy for short. 

121
00:04:10,105 --> 00:04:10,425
K. 

122
00:04:10,425 --> 00:04:11,545
Number of boys. 

123
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:15,065
Sometimes it's hard to see exactly which gender they are. 

124
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:15,785
K. 

125
00:04:15,785 --> 00:04:27,520
I am noticing that The the lights on the tree, which is what one of the things that lets you know that this is a Christmas Eve. 

126
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,240
Yeah. 

127
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,600
So what else do you see? 

128
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,825
You see a s then with your ice cube then u. 

129
00:04:37,825 --> 00:04:39,185
S q u. 

130
00:04:39,585 --> 00:04:40,945
Ice cream and. 

131
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,260
A then r then e squall over. 

132
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,620
So you got a square. 

133
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,660
Can you point out I guess that's just squares. 

134
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,380
Mean, see? 

135
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,780
I am noticing the light over here in the bushes. 

136
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,820
I'm wondering why it's there. 

137
00:05:01,785 --> 00:05:04,185
It's it's a lamppost or something else. 

138
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:05,545
Alright. 

139
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,265
K. 

140
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,385
So it kinda looks from different things. 

141
00:05:09,385 --> 00:05:09,865
Oh, see. 

142
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:11,065
Yeah. 

143
00:05:11,065 --> 00:05:13,145
But now that's It's very cozy. 

144
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:13,785
Good point. 

145
00:05:28,185 --> 00:05:29,305
To kinda warn you a bit more. 

146
00:05:29,305 --> 00:05:30,985
Let's go ahead and spell the word snow. 

147
00:05:31,385 --> 00:05:37,625
Don't S n then o n w. 

148
00:05:37,865 --> 00:05:38,425
Spell major? 

149
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:44,630
W next, I n t e and r. 

150
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,350
Child. 

151
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,910
Forest. 

152
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:52,630
Forest, f o r e s n t. 

153
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,430
Nice and done. 

154
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,990
K. 

155
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,950
So forest. 

156
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,110
So doing a sentences here. 

157
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,265
Let's use the word dog. 

158
00:05:59,505 --> 00:06:02,305
And if you're saying winter, let's do winter in a sentence. 

159
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:03,665
Winchar. 

160
00:06:03,825 --> 00:06:04,945
From this c. 

161
00:06:05,185 --> 00:06:06,305
Winchar. 

162
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:12,945
Did she have w I n t e r, winter. 

163
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,860
Next word. 

164
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,540
Winter, move your eyes. 

165
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,500
V then s r then move your eyes. 

166
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,660
So v then r, the word. 

167
00:06:29,365 --> 00:06:32,405
I and n, then move your eyes. 

168
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:36,885
It'll be m s and with a g there. 

169
00:06:36,885 --> 00:06:37,765
So it'll be s there. 

170
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:38,085
Right? 

171
00:06:38,085 --> 00:06:39,525
Did you want the word brings? 

172
00:06:39,605 --> 00:06:40,485
Okay. 

173
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:41,365
Yes. 

174
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:41,925
I did or no? 

175
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,310
Yes. 

176
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,070
Winter brings. 

177
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,590
It's really clean. 

178
00:06:50,870 --> 00:07:02,085
Winter brings s next, m next, careful, a, and l brings small. 

179
00:07:03,285 --> 00:07:04,565
And the two l's. 

180
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:07,685
Small reaching out. 

181
00:07:08,405 --> 00:07:10,005
I and n. 

182
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:21,100
I and, move your eyes, c h then e and s. 

183
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:22,700
Inches. 

184
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,500
One hour. 

185
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,745
Winter brings small inches. 

186
00:07:29,185 --> 00:07:29,825
Go ahead. 

187
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:30,385
O. 

188
00:07:30,385 --> 00:07:31,505
Move your eyes. 

189
00:07:31,505 --> 00:07:32,465
Gonna go all the way there. 

190
00:07:32,465 --> 00:07:33,425
Do what makes sense. 

191
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:34,385
Of. 

192
00:07:35,025 --> 00:07:38,305
So let's practice the o to the x so that's not having a g in it. 

193
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,600
K. 

194
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,720
F r. 

195
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,080
O, reach across. 

196
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,840
F of s then I. 

197
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,240
Okay. 

198
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,920
N o, n with your ice, shift w. 

199
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,840
Small inches of snow. 

200
00:07:56,775 --> 00:07:57,575
March. 

201
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:58,695
Wanna see it? 

202
00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:00,135
Let me get that that dog in there. 

203
00:08:00,135 --> 00:08:00,695
Zipper. 

204
00:08:00,695 --> 00:08:02,695
Bring small inches of snow. 

205
00:08:03,175 --> 00:08:05,015
C and Zipper. 

206
00:08:10,295 --> 00:08:11,175
Reaching out. 

207
00:08:11,175 --> 00:08:12,855
D then o. 

208
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,180
Reaching out. 

209
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,260
D then o. 

210
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:16,940
Zip. 

211
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,140
Zip first. 

212
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:18,780
Mhmm. 

213
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,500
G Zip. 

214
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,100
Into the snows to dogs. 

215
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:26,575
Great. 

216
00:08:27,535 --> 00:08:28,255
Nice. 

217
00:08:28,815 --> 00:08:29,375
K. 

218
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,815
Good breathing, honey. 

219
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:31,215
Very good. 

220
00:08:31,215 --> 00:08:31,535
Yes. 

221
00:08:31,535 --> 00:08:33,295
Go ahead and calm yourself down with that. 

222
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:33,855
Zippers. 

223
00:08:33,855 --> 00:08:34,015
Okay. 

224
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:34,655
We got dogs. 

225
00:08:34,655 --> 00:08:35,295
Zippers. 

226
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,095
Now let's go ahead and do the words zippers. 

227
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:40,895
Home and lights in sentence. 

228
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,930
Zebras, zip zippers. 

229
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,690
You can all zip your coat if you need to. 

230
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,570
It's a little bit chilly, though, I think, in this office. 

231
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,490
K. 

232
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,450
Home and lights. 

233
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,650
Get those in a sentence. 

234
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,050
There. 

235
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,770
You wanted to. 

236
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,450
Zebras, zip zippers. 

237
00:08:57,385 --> 00:08:58,745
C, move your eyes. 

238
00:08:58,745 --> 00:09:00,265
A, move your eyes. 

239
00:09:00,585 --> 00:09:01,225
N. 

240
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:05,785
Can. 

241
00:09:08,425 --> 00:09:09,785
Q and. 

242
00:09:10,185 --> 00:09:10,825
Pardon it. 

243
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,690
Open your eyes. 

244
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:13,970
U. 

245
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:24,130
Q u I then e and t. 

246
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:26,655
Can you see quiet? 

247
00:09:26,895 --> 00:09:27,855
Superse. 

248
00:09:32,815 --> 00:09:33,615
Quiet. 

249
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:34,655
Get quiet. 

250
00:09:34,655 --> 00:09:37,055
S then m. 

251
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:39,295
Move your eyes out of the vowel. 

252
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,350
A l l. 

253
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,910
And quiet, It should hit that l twice as I'm kinda shifting off it. 

254
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,150
And quiet, small. 

255
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,670
H next. 

256
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,085
O next. 

257
00:09:55,165 --> 00:10:04,765
H o m next. 

258
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,205
E next. 

259
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:07,085
S. 

260
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,850
I have white small homes. 

261
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,370
S. 

262
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:13,690
More spelled. 

263
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,730
Almost spelled. 

264
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:15,530
Good. 

265
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,090
H. 

266
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:16,410
Next. 

267
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,450
Move your eyes. 

268
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:20,570
Eyes. 

269
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,130
H. 

270
00:10:22,685 --> 00:10:23,165
Good. 

271
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,205
I see that. 

272
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:27,485
H and what? 

273
00:10:27,485 --> 00:10:30,285
A and b. 

274
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:35,085
Don't say don't will. 

275
00:10:52,205 --> 00:10:55,405
Have m o r. 

276
00:11:02,365 --> 00:11:03,965
Just e. 

277
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,420
Have more. 

278
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,180
Good. 

279
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,220
Then q and u. 

280
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,460
And quite small homes have more q u. 

281
00:11:20,565 --> 00:11:21,445
Okay. 

282
00:11:21,445 --> 00:11:23,285
I e t. 

283
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:24,165
Okay. 

284
00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:28,165
You're making it work, which is okay for these sentences. 

285
00:11:28,325 --> 00:11:32,325
And small homes the price of homes have more quiet. 

286
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,240
You gotta get that letter in. 

287
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,080
L good, I good, g h d s. 

288
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,720
They have lights, more quiet lights. 

289
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:49,555
We're into question one. 

290
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:50,435
That works. 

291
00:11:50,995 --> 00:11:51,395
K. 

292
00:11:51,395 --> 00:11:56,755
Now let's put the word mood in this picture into a sentence. 

293
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,410
And then we're gonna take a break from the picture for a second and do this skill workout that can help you at home. 

294
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:04,850
K. 

295
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:10,130
With the word mood in it, you can say h o m. 

296
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:15,265
E e. 

297
00:12:15,265 --> 00:12:17,265
He's got that j all the way up there. 

298
00:12:17,505 --> 00:12:30,360
Home I s is next letter? 

299
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,840
U, move your eyes. 

300
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,040
People. 

301
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,520
N. 

302
00:12:37,175 --> 00:12:38,375
For umpire. 

303
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:42,855
Is u n then move your eyes. 

304
00:12:43,015 --> 00:12:43,975
Try again. 

305
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:45,095
I or d. 

306
00:12:45,415 --> 00:12:49,095
D then e and r. 

307
00:12:49,255 --> 00:12:59,330
Home is under t. 

308
00:12:59,490 --> 00:12:59,970
Good. 

309
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,250
Keep your hand moving. 

310
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,330
And then t. 

311
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,690
You gotta shift your eyes. 

312
00:13:05,225 --> 00:13:14,345
It's under t, then h and e, the these are some soft thoughts that are in your mind that's hard to stay focused. 

313
00:13:14,825 --> 00:13:18,025
It's under the After lunch, after spelling. 

314
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:23,130
I tried m o and o then and home is under the moon. 

315
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,010
I like that. 

316
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,370
So that's what's happening there. 

317
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,890
After spelling, we'll go to home to a home store. 

318
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:29,290
Right? 

319
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,410
Raise your hand. 

320
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,330
Raise your hand. 

321
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,370
Put it out there. 

322
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,370
Give everybody this and grab some tape out. 

323
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,340
So Here we go. 

324
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:59,300
What we're gonna do is go like this. 

325
00:14:07,415 --> 00:14:08,535
Beautiful problem. 

326
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,130
I'm gonna cover up some of these rows. 

327
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:23,330
The budget of this is we're just gonna work on making words. 

328
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,970
So it builds your skills with your eye movement on the letter board. 

329
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:38,345
It's open ended, but there's no the only thing you gotta do is is one, make words, a meaning word, and two, use at least one letter on top and one on the bottom to work on stretching up and down. 

330
00:14:38,665 --> 00:14:38,985
K? 

331
00:14:38,985 --> 00:14:42,025
So with people who can do this this skill, so we're gonna take turns. 

332
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:43,880
My turn. 

333
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:49,240
So for instance, you can't spell bad because bad's only on this road, or you can't spell rust because only down here. 

334
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,360
You have to fix them. 

335
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,480
So I can start with b r, put it down there, a b e. 

336
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,440
So I'm gonna be brave. 

337
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:57,565
K? 

338
00:14:57,885 --> 00:14:58,925
Your turn. 

339
00:14:59,085 --> 00:15:01,005
Spell the word using both rows. 

340
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:06,685
C r e and s t, crest. 

341
00:15:08,685 --> 00:15:09,565
Cool. 

342
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,565
R e s t, rest. 

343
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,550
U-turn. 

344
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,990
C then what's that? 

345
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,430
C then move your eyes. 

346
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:22,150
A and r, car. 

347
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,990
C a r t s, carts. 

348
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,390
Alright. 

349
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:28,455
Clear your turn. 

350
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:29,735
I'll spell. 

351
00:15:29,815 --> 00:15:35,495
S and p e y, spay. 

352
00:15:35,895 --> 00:15:37,175
S p e, spay. 

353
00:15:37,175 --> 00:15:37,895
They they figure that. 

354
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,575
You got you got you can do something with that. 

355
00:15:39,575 --> 00:15:40,535
Do the s p e. 

356
00:15:40,535 --> 00:15:45,700
S p p e then a and d. 

357
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,740
What are you missing? 

358
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:46,980
Yes. 

359
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,020
It's gonna be s and find it. 

360
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,620
P r. 

361
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,100
There we go. 

362
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,775
E then shout. 

363
00:15:55,775 --> 00:15:56,255
Right. 

364
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,135
Almost there. 

365
00:15:57,135 --> 00:15:58,575
A and d. 

366
00:15:58,575 --> 00:15:59,295

414
00:17:59,935 --> 00:18:00,655
Okay. 

415
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:01,535

00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:06,650

423
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,170
RAP. 

424
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,050
There you go. 

425
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,210
S t r. 

426
00:18:20,815 --> 00:18:21,855
Let's see. 

427
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,415
A b. 

428
00:18:27,135 --> 00:18:27,775
Strong. 

429
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:29,055
Ow. 

430
00:18:29,055 --> 00:18:30,015
You'll turn. 

431
00:18:30,895 --> 00:18:32,015
T then. 

432
00:18:32,095 --> 00:18:32,895
R then. 

433
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:33,375
Up top. 

434
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,430
A and b. 

435
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,990
Jump. 

436
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,430
Okay. 

437
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,230
That's good enough. 

438
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:45,830
This could be a way to work with your skill, and then, like, maybe tomorrow with your dad or Ali, you can do this. 

439
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,790
And then you do this side. 

440
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:53,885
Or you could do this one. 

441
00:18:53,885 --> 00:18:57,165
Or you could do this roll cover and that roll cover or something. 

442
00:18:57,165 --> 00:19:05,940
So you can cover up different letters and find different combinations to build that open ended without there being any pressure just to make sure it's an actual word and you're in good shape. 

443
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,860
So good work. 

444
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,460
Well done. 

445
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,460
Now we go on back to our picture. 

446
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:14,580
There. 

447
00:19:18,515 --> 00:19:19,475
First. 

448
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:22,035
So now we're gonna ask questions. 

449
00:19:22,755 --> 00:19:24,035
General and specific. 

450
00:19:24,035 --> 00:19:37,530
Why we're working on this question asking is because when you are advocating for yourself in society and the environment, it's important that you're able to know what to ask of the information you need. 

451
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:44,890
So if you go to a doctor, your dad or mom may be able to ask good questions, but what if you have one? 

452
00:19:46,355 --> 00:19:53,395
Or if you're having a certain need that you haven't been able to express very well, knowing a question, you could ask how do you get that need met. 

453
00:19:54,035 --> 00:19:57,635
So so then you also creativity is for permission. 

454
00:19:57,635 --> 00:19:58,915
People who I'm prince. 

455
00:19:58,915 --> 00:19:59,955
First ask questions. 

456
00:19:59,955 --> 00:20:00,435
Okay. 

457
00:20:00,435 --> 00:20:30,160
I'm the about the speech. 

458
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,000
Something that's general about the speech. 

459
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,040
Mhmm. 

460
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,120
Happy and general question. 

461
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:42,640
So we're going on to question how, why, where, what, when, do, does, r, s, d then, o. 

462
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,145
Do Buncher. 

463
00:20:48,465 --> 00:20:52,625
M then e and All stem. 

464
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:55,665
Do Sand. 

465
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,450
Okay. 

466
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,330
You're getting stuck there. 

467
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:01,730
Great. 

468
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,690
I, n, and g. 

469
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,330
No sand. 

470
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,210
No melting. 

471
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,410
You got you're thinking that literal e and the h there. 

472
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:09,490
Okay. 

473
00:21:09,855 --> 00:21:16,815
Do melting s then n then o and Uncut.

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,600

480
00:21:39,025 --> 00:21:39,745
U. 

481
00:21:41,825 --> 00:21:43,665
I am talking to Lola. 

482
00:21:44,225 --> 00:21:44,705
Yes. 

483
00:21:44,705 --> 00:21:45,345
You get. 

484
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,385

488
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,780
F u t Okay. 

489
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,900
Let's do a louder. 

490
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,020
U r n with your eyes, go to e. 

491
00:22:04,205 --> 00:22:04,605
K. 

492
00:22:04,605 --> 00:22:05,245
I know. 

493
00:22:05,245 --> 00:22:06,525
So it's to get a future. 

494
00:22:06,765 --> 00:22:07,805
The end. 

495
00:22:07,805 --> 00:22:10,125
To get a future it might this is gonna happen. 

496
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,685
I say to get a future in the Too small. 

497
00:22:12,685 --> 00:22:14,605
In the world of water or ice. 

498
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:15,805
But No. 

499
00:22:15,805 --> 00:22:17,165
And the future is something else. 

500
00:22:17,485 --> 00:22:18,365
Take a deep breath. 

501
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,500
Take another one. 

502
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:23,820
That's great. 

503
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,620
Take another.

You're doing great.

00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,460
You're doing great. 

506
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,300
Tell yourself you're really doing great. 

507
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,740
You're doing really well. 

508
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,620
Do it again. 

509
00:22:34,085 --> 00:22:35,205

Just take it easy.

00:22:36,405 --> 00:22:38,325
Take one more big deep breath. 

512
00:22:40,165 --> 00:22:41,845
Be be really good to yourself. 

513
00:22:41,845 --> 00:22:43,205
You can change your mind. 

514
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:44,645
One more. 

515
00:22:44,645 --> 00:22:45,525
One more big one. 

516
00:22:45,525 --> 00:22:45,925
Ready? 

517
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,580
Alright. 

518
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,700
Do it for read. 

519
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,860
I improved yourself. 

520
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,700
You do not have to improve yourself. 

521
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,420
Okay. 

522
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:54,940
You're doing it. 

523
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,740
That's good. 

524
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,940
You're good with that. 

525
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,340
I'm also just gonna do an on command breathing. 

526
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,620
But if you can, start. 

527
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:02,235
Okay. 

528
00:23:02,235 --> 00:23:03,035
Important. 

529
00:23:04,555 --> 00:23:05,195
You'll go. 

530
00:23:05,195 --> 00:23:05,835
Sorry? 

531
00:23:06,235 --> 00:23:07,195
Why not? 

532
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:08,075
Okay. 

533
00:23:08,235 --> 00:23:09,835
So now my question my turn. 

534
00:23:09,835 --> 00:23:11,355
We're gonna ask to be more specific. 

535
00:23:11,355 --> 00:23:11,835
Alright. 

536
00:23:11,835 --> 00:23:24,510
You'll do all good general question, and you to make it. 

537
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,150
He has one long one here and it's a small small. 

538
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,270
He has one of those. 

539
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,550
So I'm wondering why. 

540
00:23:30,485 --> 00:23:31,125
K. 

541
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,165
Your question. 

542
00:23:32,325 --> 00:23:34,965
Let's ask a question about this tree right there. 

543
00:23:34,965 --> 00:23:38,565
What question would you ask about it that you need more information do it, honey. 

544
00:23:38,565 --> 00:23:39,205
Just relax. 

545
00:23:39,205 --> 00:23:39,685
No. 

546
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:42,245
Tissues are creative or more scientific either way. 

547
00:23:56,445 --> 00:23:57,165
Mhmm. 

548
00:23:57,325 --> 00:23:57,885
Z. 

549
00:23:57,885 --> 00:23:58,685
Now ready. 

550
00:23:59,005 --> 00:23:59,405
Mhmm. 

551
00:23:59,405 --> 00:23:59,805
Period. 

552
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:00,845
