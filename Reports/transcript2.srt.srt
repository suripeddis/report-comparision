1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
I'm a show.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,240
And if you need to do that, you can put that on the potty body.

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:04,640
Okay.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:05,840
Okay.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,760
So we're gonna do something with picture reading because this can be you can think about
pictures.

6
00:00:14,795 --> 00:00:17,675
It can unscramble that and distract us some.

7
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:18,155
Alright.

8
00:00:18,155 --> 00:00:20,235
Would you like to look at ten apps.

9
00:00:20,235 --> 00:00:21,995
These are Christmas y photos.

10
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:25,195
So if you're like, I don't do Christmas, then take this one.

11
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:25,835
This is more.

12
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:27,115
You can always do Christmas there.

13
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,860
These two are Santa in them.

14
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,180
So do you have a picture you like to look at?

15
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,100
I don't know if you're a big celebrator Christmas or not.

16
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:39,540
Xmas.

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:39,700
Yeah.

18
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,300
I know you're not religious.

19
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,100
I'm so blessed.

20
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:43,295
Express.

21
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:43,455
Hey.

22
00:00:43,455 --> 00:00:44,575
Do wanna do this one?

23
00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:45,135
This one?

24
00:00:45,135 --> 00:00:46,895
Or this this is one, two, or three?

25
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:48,495
Which one would y'all do?

26
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:50,495
You're in a three.

27
00:00:50,495 --> 00:00:51,055
Okay.

28
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:52,335
Let's do this one.

29
00:00:52,655 --> 00:00:57,560
So this is only a Christmas scene because of oh, I guess, a a couple aspects, but it doesn't
really Mhmm.

30
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,400
It's more of a winter scene than Christmas scene, so it's so it's nice that way.

31
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,640
So let's start with We do open presents at Christmas.

32
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,440
Open presents.

33
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:04,680
Okay.

34
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,960
So you still celebrate Christmas.

35
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,280
You're just personally not a believer in God.

36
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,960
That's it's fascinating to me.

37
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:10,615
I'm not paying you that.

38
00:01:10,615 --> 00:01:11,015
No.

39
00:01:11,015 --> 00:01:11,975
I hate that.

40
00:01:12,215 --> 00:01:15,095
Are you guys religious at all of the family or just Yeah.

41
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:15,495
Okay.

42
00:01:15,495 --> 00:01:15,735
Yeah.

43
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:17,015
So you're just Everything.

44
00:01:17,175 --> 00:01:20,215
You're you're you're the one who's saying you're sure.

45
00:01:20,215 --> 00:01:20,375
Okay.

46
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:23,650
So here we go.

47
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,410
Let's take a look at this right here.

48
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:30,050
The first task is gonna sound simple because you could ask them, do y'all do this?

49
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,130
But the goal of this is just to work on you being able to scan with more ease.

50
00:01:34,605 --> 00:01:35,165
K?

51
00:01:35,165 --> 00:01:37,885
And then start noticing other details.

52
00:01:38,285 --> 00:01:40,205
Even I benefit from this activity.

53
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:43,325
Even though I can scan the environment, I benefit from this activity too.

54
00:01:43,325 --> 00:01:45,005
So it's something we can all work on.

55
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:48,765
So the identification is due to working on scanning also what you're seeing.

56
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,390
So I'm noticing, first off, is this dog here.

57
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,590
K?

58
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,630
What are you noticing in this picture here?

59
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,390
Oh, how long was my x?

60
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,110
G then, I and n.

61
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:07,175
Let's just say G I then s r and l.

62
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:07,975
So square that.

63
00:02:07,975 --> 00:02:11,575
G lift, I lift, bar max l.

64
00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:15,015
And just kinda make sure you pull back a little bit more, and that will help.

65
00:02:15,015 --> 00:02:16,455
Let's go into a session, actually.

66
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,540
So you have a drill.

67
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,020
Yes.

68
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,780
Back in a couple of drills in there.

69
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,220
Let me mix it all back.

70
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:22,860
K?

71
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,700
I am noticing the string going through.

72
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,900
What are you noticing?

73
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,845
You're noticing a Push it through.

74
00:02:33,845 --> 00:02:37,925
H then o and m then.

75
00:02:38,005 --> 00:02:38,325
Okay.

76
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:38,645
X hat.

77
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:39,445
X hat now?

78
00:02:39,445 --> 00:02:39,925
It's okay.

79
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:40,725
X hat.

80
00:02:40,805 --> 00:02:41,605
E.

81
00:02:41,765 --> 00:02:42,405
Home.

82
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:43,045
Good.

83
00:02:43,285 --> 00:02:44,005
X hat.

84
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:45,285
K.

85
00:02:45,285 --> 00:02:47,045
I am able to see these two robins.

86
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,230
They're curious to me.

87
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,710
These birds.

88
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,270
K.

89
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,310
What are you noticing?

90
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,870
For your dad's video, he should know what you're looking at.

91
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,190
K.

92
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,830
You're gonna see the Context.

93
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:05,005
Context and the what?

94
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:06,605
No.

95
00:03:06,605 --> 00:03:07,325
Go for it.

96
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:08,125
Look right here.

97
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,245
What do you see?

98
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:10,685
No.

99
00:03:11,005 --> 00:03:15,810
You're the m then, o then, n.

100
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,370
The moon.

101
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,290
Two double taps on that moon.

102
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:19,490
Yeah.

103
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,690
The moon's a full moon up there.

104
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,650
It's pretty bright.

105
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,290
I actually love it when I come home from my workshop.

106
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,330
In the evening, I fly home, and it is snowing outside or snowed.

107
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,210
Not snowing.

108
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:28,690
It snowed.

109
00:03:28,905 --> 00:03:31,785
I like to walk out at midnight because it's, like, bright.

110
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:37,385
So because it's the reflection of the moon on the the snow makes it bright.

111
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:44,440
So it's still dark outside, but you can see everything, which is really peaceful because
everyone's sleeping while you're there.

112
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,200
So that's kinda it's kinda a cool time.

113
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,280
So this is a scene that we can see.

114
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,600
It's kind of more a nighttime zoom scene due to the fact that you have this moon up.

115
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,120
So we're evening scene.

116
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,160
Blustery day.

117
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,560
K.

118
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:58,265
But not then I actually have lights on in the house.

119
00:03:58,265 --> 00:03:59,785
So k.

120
00:03:59,785 --> 00:04:00,425
What else?
121

121
00:04:00,665 --> 00:04:02,345
I was gonna say other things too.

122
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:04,025
We're gonna say what?

123
00:04:05,305 --> 00:04:06,505
V then?

124
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:09,705
O and y as in boy for sure.

125
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,420
K.

126
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,540
Number of boys.

127
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,060
Sometimes it's hard to see exactly which gender they are.

128
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:15,780
K.

129
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,060
I am noticing that What's inside?

130
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:27,555
The the lights on the tree, which is what one of the things that lets you know that this is a
Christmas Eve.

131
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:28,275
Yeah.

132
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:29,555
So what else do you see?

133
00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:35,555
You see a s then with your ice cube then u.

134
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,050
S q u.

135
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:39,530
Uh-huh.

136
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,210
Cream and.

137
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:44,810
Then.

138
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,850
That's a r.

139
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:46,490
Get rid of that.

140
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,370
But a.

141
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:52,655
A then r then e squall You got a square.

142
00:04:52,655 --> 00:04:55,615
Can you point out I guess that's just mini squares.

143
00:04:55,615 --> 00:04:56,415
Let me see.

144
00:04:58,255 --> 00:05:00,735
I am noticing the light over here in the bushes.

145
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:01,935
I'm wondering why it's there.

146
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:04,175
It's it's a lamppost or something else.

147
00:05:04,655 --> 00:05:05,935
K.

148
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,350
So it kinda looks for different things.

149
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,310
Oh, it's see?

150
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,350
No.

151
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,110
That's very cozy.

152
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,150
Good point.

153
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,790
Now we're gonna take this, and we're gonna craft them into sentences.

154
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,910
We're gonna look our sentences.

155
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,070
So let's use this word.

156
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:22,525
This is sentence structure.

157
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:23,245
Going.

158
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:29,325
I'm gonna have you spell a couple of keywords first to kinda warm you a bit more.

159
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:31,005
Let's go ahead and spell the word snow.

160
00:05:31,325 --> 00:05:32,205
Need you.

161
00:05:32,525 --> 00:05:33,005
Know.

162
00:05:33,005 --> 00:05:33,885
A o one.

163
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:37,630
S n then o n w.

164
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:44,590
So W next, I n g e and r.

165
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,310
One child.

166
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,190
Forest.

167
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:52,675
Forest, f o r e s n t.

168
00:05:52,675 --> 00:05:53,395
I have them.

169
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,035
K.

170
00:05:54,035 --> 00:05:54,915
So Forest.

171
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:57,075
So doing a sentences here.

172
00:05:57,075 --> 00:05:59,235
Let's use the word dog.

173
00:05:59,555 --> 00:06:02,275
And if you're saying winter, let's do winter in a sentence.

174
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:03,395
One child.

175
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,940
Prob this thing.

176
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,220
Wincher.

177
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,060
Is she out?

178
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,340
W I n t e r, winter.

179
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,500
Next word.

180
00:06:20,215 --> 00:06:20,775
Enter.

181
00:06:20,775 --> 00:06:21,575
Move your eyes.

182
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,335
V then.

183
00:06:23,735 --> 00:06:24,215
S.

184
00:06:24,215 --> 00:06:25,735
R then.

185
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:26,535
Move your eyes.

186
00:06:26,535 --> 00:06:27,815
So v then.

187
00:06:27,815 --> 00:06:28,135
R.

188
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,400
I and n, then move your eyes.

189
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,440
Will be m.

190
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,880
S and there's a g there.

191
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,760
So there's a s there.

192
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,080
Right?

193
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,600
Did you want the word brings?

194
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,480
Okay.

195
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,440
Yes.

196
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,240
Did or no?

197
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,520
Yes.

198
00:06:44,635 --> 00:06:49,675
Rincher brings it's really clean.

199
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:56,810
Rincher brings s next, m next.

200
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,290
Careful.

201
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:02,090
A and l brings small.

202
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,570
And the two l's.

203
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,690
Small reaching out.

204
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,010
I and n.

205
00:07:14,605 --> 00:07:15,485
I n.

206
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:16,445
Move your eyes.

207
00:07:16,445 --> 00:07:20,925
C h then e and s.

208
00:07:22,045 --> 00:07:22,685
Inches.

209
00:07:22,685 --> 00:07:23,485
One hour.

210
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,690
Winter brings small inches.

211
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:29,850
Go ahead.

212
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,330
O.

213
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,530
Move your eyes.

214
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,490
Go all the there.

215
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,450
Do what makes sense.

216
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,330
Of.

217
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,330
So let's practice the o to the s so that's not having a g in it.

218
00:07:39,185 --> 00:07:39,665
Yeah.

219
00:07:39,665 --> 00:07:40,785
F r.

220
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:42,225
O, which is crossed.

221
00:07:42,305 --> 00:07:45,905
F of s then I.

222
00:07:45,905 --> 00:07:46,225
Okay.

223
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:49,905
N o, n with your eyes, shift w.

224
00:07:50,225 --> 00:07:51,905
Small inches of snow.

225
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,620
Watch.

226
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,740
Wanna see you.

227
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,100
You get that that dog in there.

228
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:00,660
Zipper.

229
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,660
Bring small inches of snow.

230
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:03,620
See?

231
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,660
And Zipper.

232
00:08:10,305 --> 00:08:11,025
Did you know?

233
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:13,265
D then o.

234
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:17,025
Zippers.

235
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:17,665
Zippers.

236
00:08:18,145 --> 00:08:18,785
Mhmm.

237
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:21,505
G Zippers.

238
00:08:22,225 --> 00:08:22,465
Zippers.

239
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,410
Into the snows to dogs.

240
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:26,610
Great.

241
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,290
Nice.

242
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:29,330
K.

243
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,770
Good reading, honey.

244
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:31,250
You're good.

245
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:31,410
Yeah.

246
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,250
Let's go ahead and calm your knees all down like that.

247
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:33,890
Same first.

248
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,090
You got dog first.

249
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:37,975
Now let's go ahead and do the words zippers.

250
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,095
Home and lights in a sentence.

251
00:08:41,095 --> 00:08:41,735
Zippers.

252
00:08:41,735 --> 00:08:43,015
Zip zippers.

253
00:08:44,695 --> 00:08:46,695
You can all zip your code if you need to.

254
00:08:46,695 --> 00:08:49,255
It's a little bit chillier, I think, in this office.

255
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,550
K.

256
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,350
Hold in line.

257
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,710
Let's get those in a sentence.

258
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:53,870
There.

259
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,750
If you wanted to.

260
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,550
See bras.

261
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,110
C.

262
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,750
Move your ice.

263
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,230
A.

264
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,270
Move your ice.

265
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:00,910
N.

266
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:05,755
Can.

267
00:09:08,475 --> 00:09:09,755
Q and.

268
00:09:10,235 --> 00:09:11,115
Hide it.

269
00:09:11,355 --> 00:09:12,635
Open your eyes.

270
00:09:13,195 --> 00:09:13,595
U.

271
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:24,520
Q u I then e and t.

272
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,440
Quiet.

273
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,320
Zippers.

274
00:09:32,815 --> 00:09:33,695
Quiet.

275
00:09:33,855 --> 00:09:34,655
Again, quiet.

276
00:09:34,655 --> 00:09:37,135
S, then m.

277
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:38,015
Move your i's.

278
00:09:38,015 --> 00:09:39,615
I'll lift your vowels up to a vowel.

279
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:43,295
A l l.

280
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:44,975
And quiet, small.

281
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:47,535
It should hit that l twice instead of kinda shifting off it.

282
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:48,790
K.

283
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,230
Quiet small.

284
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,750
H next.

285
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,110
O next.

286
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:07,435
H o m next, e next, s.

287
00:10:07,595 --> 00:10:09,835
I have quiet small homes.

288
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:11,435
Last.

289
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:13,915
Most spelled.

290
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:14,795
Spelling.

291
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:15,515
Good.

292
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:16,475
H next.

293
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:17,115
Move your eyes.

294
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,560
Eyes.

295
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,520
H.

296
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,200
Good.

297
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,760
Move your eyes.

298
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,160
Yeah.

299
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,760
H and find it.

300
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,935
A and b.

301
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,370
M.

302
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,250
Good.

303
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,650
And the o.

304
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:57,005
Have m o r.

305
00:11:02,365 --> 00:11:04,365
Just e.

306
00:11:05,245 --> 00:11:06,125
Half more.

307
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,120
Good.

308
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,240
Then q and u.

309
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,800
In quite small homes have more q u.

310
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,480
Okay.

311
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,355
I e t.

312
00:11:23,435 --> 00:11:24,155
Okay.

313
00:11:24,635 --> 00:11:28,155
You're making orc, which is okay for these sentences.

314
00:11:28,315 --> 00:11:32,635
And small homes for the small homes, have more quiet.

315
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:36,235
You gotta get that letter in.

316
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:42,110
L good, I good, g h d s.

317
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,070
They have lights, more quiet lights.

318
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,630
We need do question one.

319
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,190
That works.

320
00:11:50,995 --> 00:11:51,395
K.

321
00:11:51,395 --> 00:11:57,075
Now let's put the the word mood in this picture into a sentence.

322
00:11:59,315 --> 00:12:03,155
And then we're gonna take a break from the picture for a second and do the skill workout that
can help you at home.

323
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:04,920
K.

324
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:11,800
With the it, you can say h o m oops.

325
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,200
I'll do it right this way.

326
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,320
H o m e e.

327
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,000
Just got that j on the way up there.

328
00:12:19,195 --> 00:12:30,395
Home I s is next letter?

329
00:12:31,355 --> 00:12:32,475
U, move your eyes.

330
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,120
People.

331
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,360
N, because u n is umbrella.

332
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
It will make sense for umpire.

333
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,840
Is u n, then move your eyes.

334
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,040
Try again.

335
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,080
I or d.

336
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,760
D then e and r.

337
00:12:49,305 --> 00:12:59,305
Home is under t.

338
00:12:59,465 --> 00:12:59,945
Good.

339
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,225
Keep your hand moving.

340
00:13:01,785 --> 00:13:03,305
And then t.

341
00:13:03,385 --> 00:13:05,000
You gotta shift your eyes.

342
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:14,360
It's under t, then h and e the these are some soft thoughts that are awaiting your mind, and it's
hard to stay focused.

343
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,040
It's under the After lunch or after spelling.

344
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,505
Let's try it m o and o then.

345
00:13:21,505 --> 00:13:23,105
And home is under the moon.

346
00:13:23,105 --> 00:13:23,985
I like that.

347
00:13:24,145 --> 00:13:25,425
So that's what's happening there.

348
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:28,945
After spelling, we'll go to home to the home store.

349
00:13:28,945 --> 00:13:29,265
Right?

350
00:13:29,265 --> 00:13:30,465
Raise your hand.

351
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,425
Raise your hand and put it out there.

352
00:13:33,425 --> 00:13:50,365
Get So here we go.

353
00:13:50,365 --> 00:13:59,325
What we're gonna do is go like this.

354
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,530
No problem.

355
00:14:16,325 --> 00:14:18,085
K.

356
00:14:18,645 --> 00:14:20,165
I'm gonna cut up some of these rows.

357
00:14:20,165 --> 00:14:23,365
The budget of this is we're just gonna work on making words.

358
00:14:24,005 --> 00:14:27,925
So it builds your skills with your eye movement on the letter board.

359
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:38,350
It's open ended, but there's no the only thing you gotta do is is one, make words, can be any
word, and two, use at least one letter on top and one on the bottom to work on stretching up and
down.

360
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:38,990
K?

361
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,070
So with people, you can do this this skill.

362
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,030
So we're gonna take turns.

363
00:14:43,275 --> 00:14:43,835
My turn.

364
00:14:43,835 --> 00:14:49,275
So for instance, you can't spell bad because bad's only on this row, or you can't spell rust
because it's only down here.

365
00:14:49,275 --> 00:14:50,395
You're not gonna fix them.

366
00:14:50,395 --> 00:14:53,435
So I can start with b r, put it down here, a b e.

367
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:54,715
So I'm gonna be brave.

368
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:57,195
K?

369
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:58,930
Your turn.

370
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,930
Spell the word using both rows.

371
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:06,610
C r e and s t, rest.

372
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:09,490
Cool.

373
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,570
R e s t, rest.

374
00:15:13,595 --> 00:15:14,475
Uter.

375
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,995
C then what's that?

376
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:19,435
C then move your eyes.

377
00:15:19,435 --> 00:15:22,315
A and r, Carr.

378
00:15:23,515 --> 00:15:25,995
C a r t s, Carts.

379
00:15:25,995 --> 00:15:26,715
Alright.

380
00:15:27,275 --> 00:15:27,835
Uter.

381
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,750
I'll spell.

382
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:35,510
S and p e y, spay.

383
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,190
S p e, spay.

384
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:37,910
They they figure that.

385
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,590
You got you got you can do something with that.

386
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,550
The s p e.

387
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,685
S p then a and d.

388
00:15:45,685 --> 00:15:46,885
What letter are you missing?

389
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:52,005
It's gonna be s and find it.

390
00:15:52,005 --> 00:15:53,685
P r.

391
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:54,485
There we go.

392
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:55,765
E then shout.

393
00:15:55,765 --> 00:15:56,245
Right.

394
00:15:56,245 --> 00:15:57,125
Almost there.

395
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,645
A and d.

396
00:15:58,645 --> 00:15:58,965
Spread.

397
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,600
Good.

398
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,320
My turn.

399
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:08,200
I'm gonna do the words w a s was.

400
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,680
Your turn.

401
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:13,815
A then.

402
00:16:14,615 --> 00:16:15,815
Come come to it.

403
00:16:15,815 --> 00:16:16,215
R.

404
00:16:16,215 --> 00:16:17,015
Come to it.

405
00:16:17,255 --> 00:16:17,655
T.

406
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:18,135
Come to it.

407
00:16:18,135 --> 00:16:18,375
Okay.

408
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:18,775
There we go.

409
00:16:18,775 --> 00:16:19,495
Art.

410
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:21,095
My turn.

411
00:16:21,975 --> 00:16:23,735
T e a t.

412
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:25,770
Your turn.

413
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:31,770
Thank thank thank Hayden, r and e r.

414
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,410
Good.

415
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:34,890
My turn.

416
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:39,610
Let's do s t a r t s starts.

417
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:43,285
Your turn.

418
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:51,365
P e s t, best.

419
00:16:53,685 --> 00:16:54,885
My turn.

420
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,240
P e s t, pest.

421
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,760
Your turn.

422
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,720
R e s t.

423
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,760
I got rest, sadly.

424
00:17:09,165 --> 00:17:10,125
Already did.

425
00:17:11,725 --> 00:17:18,125
P r e s and Press it.

426
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,085
Press it twice.

427
00:17:19,325 --> 00:17:20,125
Press.

428
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:20,925
Press.

429
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,520
Press.

430
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,480
My turn.

431
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,840
D r e w, Drew.

432
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,880
Your turn.

433
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:35,880
V.

434
00:17:37,415 --> 00:17:38,375
Stop.

435
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:41,175
These are e s t.

436
00:17:41,175 --> 00:17:41,575
Vast.

437
00:17:41,575 --> 00:17:42,375
That works.

438
00:17:44,615 --> 00:17:46,375
V e r y, very.

439
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:49,415
Near term.

440
00:17:49,415 --> 00:17:52,580
There's hundreds of words there, so we're only going to go for so long.

441
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,580
Okay.

442
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,540
Okay.

443
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,620
R then?

444
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,260
Okay.

445
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:04,980
Yep.

446
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,100
R then?

447
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,420
Okay.

448
00:18:08,485 --> 00:18:11,685
R then a and p.

449
00:18:11,685 --> 00:18:12,005
R.

450
00:18:12,005 --> 00:18:13,045
There you go.

451
00:18:16,005 --> 00:18:17,605
S t r.

452
00:18:20,805 --> 00:18:21,525
Let's see.

453
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,430
A b.

454
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:27,870
Strong.

455
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:29,950
Will turn.

456
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,710
T then, r then up top.

457
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,470
A and b.

458
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:35,950
Jump.

459
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,270
That's good enough.

460
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:45,785
So This could be a way to work with your scalp, and then, like, maybe tomorrow with your dad
or Ali, you can do this.

461
00:18:45,785 --> 00:18:57,170
And then you do this side, or you could do this one, or you could do this roll cover and that roll
cover or something.

462
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:05,650
So you can cover up different letters and find their combinations to build that open ended
without there being any pressure on this just to make sure it's an actual word, and you're in
good shape.

463
00:19:05,815 --> 00:19:07,895
So it didn't work.

464
00:19:10,535 --> 00:19:11,495
Well done.

465
00:19:11,575 --> 00:19:13,495
Now we go on back to our picture.

466
00:19:14,295 --> 00:19:14,615
There.

467
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,520
First.

468
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,000
So now we're gonna ask questions.

469
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,080
General and specific.

470
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:37,525
While we're working on this question asking is because when you are advocating for yourself in
society and the environment, it's important that you're able to know what to ask to get
information you need.

471
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:43,845
So if you go to a doctor, your dad or mom may be able to ask some questions.

472
00:19:43,845 --> 00:19:45,205
But what if you have one?

473
00:19:46,325 --> 00:19:53,420
Or if you're having a certain need that you haven't been able to express very well, knowing a
question, you could ask with how you get that need met.

474
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,860
So so then you also creativity is formed from people who are this prince.

475
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,980
First, ask questions.

476
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,460
What's up?

477
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,340
I'm the prince.

478
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:01,725
Like space travel.

479
00:20:01,725 --> 00:20:02,845
Space travel.

480
00:20:02,925 --> 00:20:03,805
What is that?

481
00:20:03,885 --> 00:20:04,845
Is it possible?

482
00:20:04,845 --> 00:20:06,125
People wrote stories.

483
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,525
Then the scientists came along and asked more questions.

484
00:20:08,605 --> 00:20:11,085
And how can you actually make it happen that it happened?

485
00:20:11,245 --> 00:20:13,885
So if people didn't ask questions, there wouldn't be creativity.

486
00:20:13,885 --> 00:20:14,685
There wouldn't be science.

487
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:16,930
So that's what we're working on.

488
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:17,570
This is very important.

489
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,370
You know how to ask questions.

490
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,250
And kids do it naturally.

491
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,650
Kids ask more questions than anybody on the planet.

492
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,090
They ask tons.

493
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,170
So we're working on that scale.

494
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:25,890
Alright.

495
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:30,165
So go ahead and do a question about the speech.

496
00:20:30,165 --> 00:20:32,005
Something just general about the speech.

497
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:32,645
Happy.

498
00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:33,045
Happy.

499
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,125
And general question.

500
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:40,565
So we're going on to question how, why, where, what, when, do, does, r, is.

501
00:20:40,565 --> 00:20:41,845
D then?

502
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,090
O.

503
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,130
Do Gotcha.

504
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:52,370
M then e and All sound.

505
00:20:54,465 --> 00:20:55,985
Do Sand.

506
00:20:57,345 --> 00:20:57,825
Felt.

507
00:20:57,825 --> 00:20:58,225
Okay.

508
00:21:00,465 --> 00:21:01,345
You're gonna stop there.

509
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:01,745
Great.

510
00:21:01,745 --> 00:21:04,705
I n and g.

511
00:21:04,705 --> 00:21:05,345
No sand.

512
00:21:05,345 --> 00:21:06,225
No melting.

513
00:21:06,225 --> 00:21:09,345
You got you're thinking that literal e and the h there.

514
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:09,870
Okay.

515
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:17,390
Do melting s then n then o and On on the cut.

516

I'd say to get a future in the Too small.

00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,230
In the world of water or ice.

Right.

541
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:15,815
No.

542
00:22:15,815 --> 00:22:17,415
And a future in something else.

You're doing really well.

551

I improved ourself.

563
00:22:50,835 --> 00:22:52,675
You do not have to prove yourself.

564
00:22:52,755 --> 00:22:53,395
Okay.

565
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:54,915
You're doing it.

566
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:55,475
That's good.

567
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:56,950
You're good with that.

568
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,350
I'm also just gonna do a on command breathing.

569
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,190
But if you can, it's powerful.

570
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,430
You'll go.

571
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:05,830
Sorry?

572
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,190
Why not?

573
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,750
Okay.

574
00:23:08,265 --> 00:23:09,785
So now my my turn.

575
00:23:09,785 --> 00:23:11,385
We're gonna ask to be more specific.

576
00:23:11,385 --> 00:23:11,865
Alright.

577
00:23:11,865 --> 00:23:12,185
Yeah.

578
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:13,705
So I'll good general question.

579
00:23:13,705 --> 00:23:16,665
And you actually didn't become specific about the snowman, so I like that.

580
00:23:16,665 --> 00:23:18,025
I'll ask the question about the snowman.

581
00:23:18,025 --> 00:23:24,580
I would ask the question, why doesn't he have three three balls to make him?

582
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,140
He has one long one here, and it's a small ball.

583
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,340
He has nothing else.

584
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,860
So I'm wondering why.

585
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,140
Hey.

586
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,180
Your question.

Let's ask a question about this tree right there.

588
00:23:34,835 --> 00:23:37,635
What question would you ask about it that you need more information?

Do it, honey.

590

No.

592
00:23:39,955 --> 00:23:42,515
Dishes are creative or more scientific either way.

593
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:44,915
Incorrect.

594
00:23:44,915 --> 00:23:45,395

You got it.

602
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,270
So you're gonna ask a question.

603

Now ready to go for it.
